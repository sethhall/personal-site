I am a research engineer in the networking group at ICSI.  My primary activity
is working on the Bro Intrusion Detection System and promoting it's use
in various industries under a grant from the NSF in the SDCI program.

If you are looking for someone to attend an event and speak about Bro, please
contact me.

About Me
--------

I received my undergraduate degree in Geography from The Ohio State University
in 2003 and began working full time for the OSU Network Security Team in
January 2004. As a member of a small team on a large network I played a large
number of roles in helping secure the university. Eventually I discovered Bro
and found that I could provide a large benefit by using novel detection
techniques by watching the network with Bro. Time progressed and now I'm
working on Bro full time.

I currently live in Worthinton, OH with my wife and two children.
