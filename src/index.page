I am a research engineer in the `networking group <http://www.icir.org/>`_ at ICSI_. My primary activity
is working on the `Bro Intrusion Detection System <http://www.bro-ids.org/>`_
and promoting its use in various industries under a grant from the NSF in the
SDCI program.

If you are looking for someone to attend an event and speak about Bro, please
contact me.

About Me
--------
I received my undergraduate degree in Geography from `The Ohio State
University <http://www.osu.edu/>`_ in 2003 and began working full time for the
`OSU Network Security Team <http://www.infosec.ohio-state.edu/>`_ in January
2004. As a member of a small team on a large network I played a large number
of roles in helping secure the university. Eventually I discovered Bro and
found that I could provide a large benefit with novel detection techniques by
watching the network with Bro. Time progressed and now I'm working on Bro full
time.

I currently live in Worthington, OH with my wife and two children.
